# Breast-Cancer-Detection-with-ML
1. A small comparison between the K Nearest Neighbors Classification and Support Vector Machine Classification.
2. Popularly known, UCI Dataset is used here for the Breast Cancer Detection problem. 
3. K Nearest Neighbors Classification is a clustering algorithm as we are well aware of.
4. Support Vector Machine produces very good accuracy with less computation power.
5. In this, we will be comparing the results from both the methods on the problem of Breast Cancer Detection.
6. The packages or the libraries along with their versions we need to do this are as follows:     
   * numpy        1.18.1
   * matplotlib   3.1.3
   * pandas       1.0.1
   * sklearn      0.22.1
7. There is this UCI Repository which has a collection of lots of various datasets. The link is provided here.
[UCI Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/breast-cancer-wisconsin.data)
8. 20% of the data is for testing the model.
9. I got the KNN accuracy to be 97.85714% whereas SVM accuracy to be 68.5714% which is quite low.
10. The SVM accuracy was quite low but this is my first commit in ML. So, I shall be changing that soon.
