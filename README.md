# Breast-Cancer-Detection-with-ML
1. A small comparison between the K Nearest Neighbors Classification and Support Vector Machine Classification.
2. Popularly known, UCI Dataset is used here for the Breast Cancer Detection problem. 
3. K Nearest Neighbors Classification is a clustering algorithm as we are well aware of.
4. Support Vector Machine produces very good accuracy with less computation power.
5. In this, we will be comparing the results from both the methods on the problem of Breast Cancer Detection
