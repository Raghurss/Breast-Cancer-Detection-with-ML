# Breast-Cancer-Detection-with-ML
### A small comparison between the K Nearest Neighbors Classification and Support Vector Machine Classification on UCI Dataset for Breast Cancer Detection
#### K Nearest Neighbors Classification is a clustering algorithm as we are well aware of!
#### Support Vector Machine produces very good accuracy with less computation power.
#### In this, we will be comparing the results from both the methods on the problem of Breast Cancer Detection
